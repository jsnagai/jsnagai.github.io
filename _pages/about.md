I'm a 25 year old Doctoral Researcher @ [Institute for Computational Genomics, RWTH Uniklinik Aachen](https://costalab.org/). My research is related to the development of methods and approaches to dissect biological processes using complex networks and graph theory. I am third generation Japanese descendent, born and raised in Mogi das Cruzes, S.P. Brazil. I am currently based in Aachen, Germany.
