CrossTalkeR is a framework for network analysis and visualisation of LR networks. CrossTalkeR identifies relevant ligands, receptors and cell types contributing to changes in cell communication when contrasting two biological states: disease vs. homeostasis. A case study on scRNA-seq of human myeloproliferative neoplasms reinforces the strengths of CrossTalkeR for characterisation of changes in cellular crosstalk in disease state.[Check it out](https://github.com/CostaLab/CrossTalkeR).
