This is the code repository for the paper "Gene Essentiality Prediction Using Topological Features From Metabolic Networks" to be presented at 7th Brazilian Conference on Intelligent Systems (BRACIS) in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil. In this work, we evaluate the influence and the contribution of network topological features for the essential gene prediction task in metabolic networks.
